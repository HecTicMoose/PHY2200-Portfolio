# PHY2200-Portfolio
This is a collection of all of the projects I've completed during a computational physics course taken at High Point University in the spring semester of 2022.

Project 0: 
  This project is a simulation of a non-traditional plinko board where instead of the ball going through the bottom well, it bounces back up and continues until the WHILE loop is completed. The purpose was to look at how the radius of the ball compared to the rods effects where the ball will land. I plotted the average position of where the ball would land each time.https://github.com/HecTicMoose/PHY2200-Portfolio/blob/fad86c8566c2f9df6b10fb8435bebbe1d42d8efb/Plinko_Project.ipynb
  
Project 01: 
  This project is a simulation of a double pendulum where I look at and analyse how changining the lengnth and masses of each rod and ball effect the chatoic motion. https://github.com/HecTicMoose/PHY2200-Portfolio/blob/5f0b8ebd92f3275610759fcb1399cd9c06ab3b5d/Double%20Pendulum%20Nick.ipynb
  
Project 02: 
  This project is a copy of the popular IOS game Paper Toss. I implemented drag coefficients to calculate the flight of the ball and made it interactive so the user can imput their own intial angle to throw the ball. https://github.com/HecTicMoose/PHY2200-Portfolio/blob/3883eb0fb3055c0eb78d0d170ea84c10a5d07e16/Project%2002
  
Project 03: 
  This project is a simulation of a fixed and free ended oscillator. The goal was to model a free and fixed end oscillator and plot the oscillations of each mass. https://github.com/HecTicMoose/PHY2200-Portfolio/blob/4c48836f382d013e7339f24d0ac10f5b7782cf8b/Project%2003
  
Final Project: 
  This project uses modified node analysis to represent a circuit using matrices. It only involves passive elements like resistors and independent sources in a circuit. https://github.com/HecTicMoose/PHY2200-Portfolio/blob/b631c689fe649aef045e6949a35cec59d858c6c9/Final%20Project
